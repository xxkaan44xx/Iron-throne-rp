   ```

Check these URLs after 2-3 minutes:
- https://iron-throne-rp-gs14.onrender.com/ (should show bot status)
- https://iron-throne-rp-gs14.onrender.com/health (should return JSON)

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- Home page shows "Status: RUNNING"
- Health endpoint returns `{"status": "healthy", "bot_process": "running"}`
- Discord bot appears online in your servers
- Commands work in Discord

### ‚ùå If Something Fails:
1. Check Render deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Make sure GitHub files are uploaded
4. Visit /restart endpoint to force restart

## Database Fix Applied ‚úÖ
Fixed the "Cannot operate on a closed database" error by improving connection handling in the economy system.

## 24/7 Operation
Once deployed, your bot will:
- Run 24/7 on Render's free tier (750 hours/month)
- Automatically restart if it crashes
- Handle "wake up" delays gracefully
- Maintain all 153+ commands functionality

## Final Notes
- Free tier may "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep may take 30 seconds to respond
- Your Discord bot stays running even during web server sleep
- Monitor usage to stay within 750 hour monthly limit
