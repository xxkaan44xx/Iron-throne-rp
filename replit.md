## Overview

This is the ultimate Discord role-playing bot themed around Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire. The bot allows users to create alliances (houses), engage in warfare, manage economies, and roleplay as characters from the series. Built with Python and Discord.py, it features a command-based architecture with modular systems for combat, economics, character progression, auto-moderation, and performance optimization.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Key Requirement:** Every system that has an "opening" command MUST have a corresponding "closing" command. Always implement complete command pairs without exceptions. After every change, fix all errors completely.

**24/7 Hosting Preference:** User wants completely free, unlimited hosting solutions for Discord bot. Explored Replit Deployments (paid), Railway (500h limit), Oracle Cloud (app won't install), Google Cloud (interested), and UptimeRobot integration.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Discord.py (Python Discord library) for bot functionality
- **Database**: SQLite for local data persistence with foreign key constraints
- **Architecture Pattern**: Command-based bot with modular system components
- **Background Tasks**: Asynchronous task loops for automated income generation and debt interest calculation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging system with file and console output

### Core Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Separate modules for different game systems (war, economy, database)
- **Persistence**: All game state stored in SQLite database
- **Real-time Processing**: Background tasks handle time-based game mechanics
- **Rich Interactions**: Discord embeds for enhanced user experience

## Key Components

### Database Layer (`database.py`)
- **SQLite Schema**: Comprehensive tables for alliances, members, wars, income sources, and battle logs
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintains data integrity across related tables
- **Transaction Management**: Proper commit/rollback handling for data consistency
- **Default Data Population**: Pre-populates canonical ASOIAF houses and characters

### Command System (`commands.py`)
- **Extensive Character Database**: Pre-defined ASOIAF characters with houses, titles, ages, and skills
- **Discord Slash Commands**: Modern Discord interaction handling
- **Rich Embeds**: Consistent styling with house emojis and formatting
- **Input Validation**: Character and house name validation functions

### War System (`war_system.py`)
- **Turn-based Combat**: Strategic battle system with multiple action types
- **Environmental Effects**: Weather and terrain modifiers affecting battle outcomes
- **Battle Actions**: Five distinct combat strategies (attack, defend, maneuver, retreat, assault)
- **Damage Calculation**: Complex algorithms considering army size, actions, and environmental factors
- **War State Management**: Active war tracking with turn limits and victory conditions

### Economy System (`economy.py`)
- **Automated Income**: Background task generating resources from controlled territories
- **Debt Management**: Interest calculation and debt tracking system
- **Resource Types**: Gold, soldiers, and power points as core currencies
- **Income Sources**: Territorial control generating passive income

### Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- **Discord Embeds**: Consistent styling and formatting utilities
- **Number Formatting**: Large number display with comma separators
- **House Emojis**: Visual representation for different houses
- **Weather/Terrain Systems**: Environmental condition management
- **Character Progression**: Experience-based leveling system

## Data Flow

### Command Processing
1. User issues Discord command
2. Command handler validates input and permissions
3. Database operations execute game logic
4. Response formatted as rich embed
5. Result sent back to Discord channel

### Background Systems
1. **Income Generation**: Every minute, scan income sources and distribute resources
2. **Debt Interest**: Hourly calculation of debt interest for all alliances
3. **War Management**: Continuous monitoring of active conflicts

### Character Progression
1. Actions generate experience points
2. Experience accumulates to unlock new levels
3. Levels improve combat statistics
4. Character classes provide specialized abilities

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **discord.py**: Discord API integration and bot framework
- **sqlite3**: Built-in Python SQLite database interface
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous programming for background tasks
- **logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and debugging

### Data Sources
- **Pre-defined Content**: Extensive ASOIAF character and house database
- **Environmental Systems**: Weather and terrain effect libraries
- **Combat Mechanics**: Battle action and damage calculation systems

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- **SQLite Database**: Self-contained database file for easy setup
- **Environment Variables**: Bot token and configuration through environment
- **Logging**: File-based logging for debugging and monitoring

### Configuration Management
- **config.py**: Centralized game balance and system parameters
- **Database Path**: Configurable database location
- **Game Constants**: Tunable values for combat, economy, and progression

### Background Task Management
- **Discord.py Tasks**: Integrated task scheduling for automated systems
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of task failures and restarts
- **System State**: Global flags to control active systems

### Scalability Considerations
- **SQLite Limitations**: Single-file database suitable for moderate usage
- **Background Task Efficiency**: Optimized queries for automated systems
- **Memory Management**: Proper connection handling and resource cleanup

The bot is designed as a comprehensive roleplay experience combining strategic warfare, economic management, and character progression in the Game of Thrones universe. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and modification of game systems while maintaining data integrity and user experience quality.
